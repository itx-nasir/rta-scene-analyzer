## üéØ **Project Overview**

**Challenge:** Build a full-stack application for traffic scene analysis with object detection, scene classification, and natural language description generation.

**Result:** A production-ready web application with professional UI and dual AI model integration.

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture & Technical Decisions**

### **Tech Stack Selection Rationale:**

| Technology | Reasoning |
|------------|-----------|
| **FastAPI** | Fast development, automatic API docs, async support |
| **Jinja2 Templates** | Single-app architecture (no separate frontend needed) |
| **YOLOv8 Nano** | Balance between speed and accuracy for real-time detection |
| **Places365 ResNet18** | Comprehensive scene classification (365 categories) |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Rapid UI development with professional styling |
| **Vanilla JavaScript** | No framework overhead, direct browser API access |

### **Key Architectural Decisions:**

1. **Monolithic over Microservices:** Single FastAPI app for faster development
2. **Template-based UI:** Jinja2 instead of separate React frontend
3. **Dual Model Approach:** Separate object detection and scene classification
4. **Rule-based NLP:** Template generation instead of LLM for descriptions
5. **Local File Storage:** Static directories for processed images

---

## üìã **Development Journey: Step-by-Step Process**

### **Phase 1: Project Setup & Planning**

#### 1.1 Repository Initialization
```bash
# Created GitHub repository
git clone https://github.com/itx-nasir/rta-scene-analyzer.git
cd rta-scene-analyzer

# Initial project structure
mkdir app templates static
mkdir static/uploads static/processed
```

#### 1.2 Requirements Analysis
- **Input:** Image upload + webcam capture
- **Processing:** Object detection + scene classification
- **Output:** Processed image + natural language description
- **UI:** Professional, responsive web interface

#### 1.3 Technology Research
- Evaluated YOLO variants (chose v8 for latest features)
- Researched scene classification models (Places365 for traffic scenes)
- Decided on FastAPI + Jinja2 over separate frontend

### **Phase 2: Backend Foundation**

#### 2.1 Dependencies & Environment Setup
```python
# requirements.txt - Carefully selected for minimal conflicts
fastapi              # Web framework
uvicorn[standard]    # ASGI server
jinja2              # Template engine
python-multipart    # File upload support
aiofiles            # Async file operations
ultralytics         # YOLOv8 implementation
torch               # PyTorch for deep learning
torchvision         # Vision utilities
opencv-python       # Image processing
pillow              # Image manipulation
numpy               # Numerical operations
requests            # HTTP requests for model downloads
```

#### 2.2 AI Models Integration (`app/models.py`)

**Challenge:** Integrating two different AI models with different input/output formats

**Solution:** Created unified interface with preprocessing pipelines

```python
# YOLOv8 Integration Strategy:
- Used ultralytics library for simplicity
- Implemented bounding box drawing directly in OpenCV
- Added confidence score overlays
- Saved processed images with unique filenames

# Places365 Integration Strategy:
- Downloaded pre-trained ResNet18 weights
- Implemented proper ImageNet normalization
- Created scene category mapping from text file
- Added automatic model downloading
```

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- **YOLOv8 Nano:** Faster inference over accuracy for demo purposes
- **Custom Drawing:** Manual bounding box implementation for full control
- **Error Handling:** Graceful model loading with download fallbacks

#### 2.3 Scene Description Generation (`app/utils.py`)

**Challenge:** Generate natural language without using large language models

**Solution:** Rule-based template system with contextual logic

```python
# Template Strategy:
1. Object counting and categorization
2. Scene-specific template selection
3. Grammatical object list generation
4. Context-aware sentence construction
5. Traffic-specific insights addition
```

**Algorithm Flow:**
```
Input: scene_class="highway", objects=[{car}, {truck}, {person}]
‚Üì
Count objects by type: {"car": 1, "truck": 1, "person": 1}
‚Üì
Select template: "This appears to be a busy highway scene"
‚Üì
Generate object phrase: "with a car, a truck, and a person"
‚Üì
Add context: "Both pedestrians and vehicles are present"
‚Üì
Output: "This appears to be a busy highway scene with a car, a truck, and a person. Both pedestrians and vehicles are present."
```

### **Phase 3: Web Application Development**

#### 3.1 FastAPI Backend (`app/main.py`)

**Challenge:** Handle file uploads, serve templates, and coordinate AI models

**Solution:** Clean separation of concerns with async processing

```python
# Route Strategy:
@app.get("/")          # Serve main UI template
@app.post("/analyze")  # Handle image analysis
@app.get("/health")    # System status endpoint

# File Handling Strategy:
- Async file reading with aiofiles
- UUID-based unique filenames
- Separate upload and processed directories
- Proper error handling and cleanup
```

#### 3.2 Frontend Architecture (`templates/`)

**Challenge:** Create professional UI with webcam support and real-time feedback
